## Overview

This is an attempt to formally describe IAB OpenDirect v1.5 protocol using RAML and Json Schema.

- See opendirect.yaml for RAML schema 
- See opendirect.html for HTML representation 
- see /schemas for individual JSON schemas

Note: there are many issues and incosistences in the protocol document and examples (see https://github.com/OpenDirect/Spec-Review/issues), and some of this represents my own view on how things should be implemented, which may not be shared by other IAB members, so use these schemas with care and report any issues.

## TODO

1. Fix issues as they get resolved in the protocol 
2. Add support for change requests and change request lines
